# TEAM-TITANS-BACKEND

# Installation and Setup

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your development environment:

1. **PHP**: Laravel requires PHP 7.4 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running `php -v`.
2. **Composer**: Composer is a PHP package manager used for Laravel's dependency management. You can download it from [getcomposer.org]().
3. **Web Server**: You can use Apache, Nginx, or Laravel's built-in development server (for local development).
4. **Database**: Laravel supports multiple database systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and SQL Server. Ensure you have one of these databases installed and configured.
5. **Git**: Git is a version control system used for managing the project's source code.
    

## Cloning and Preparing the Laravel Application

Follow these steps to clone and prepare the Laravel application:

### 1\. Clone the Repository

Clone the Laravel repository from Github using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hngx-org/Titans-food-backend.git
 ```

### 2\. Navigate to Your Project Directory

Change your current working directory to the cloned project folder:

```bash
cd titans-food-backend
 ```

### 3\. Install Composer Dependencies

Use Composer to install the project's PHP dependencies:

```bash
composer install
 ```

### 4\. Copy the Environment File

Make a copy of the provided `.env.example` file and name it `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
 ```

Edit the `.env` file to configure your database connection, application URL, and any other necessary configuration options.

### 5\. Generate an Application Key

Generate an application key for your Laravel application:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
 ```

This key is used for encrypting session and cookie data.

### 6\. Migrate the Database

Run the database migrations to create the necessary database tables:

```bash
php artisan migrate
 ```

### 8\. Start the Development Server

To start a development server, use the following Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan serve
 ```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:8000`. Access your Laravel application by visiting this URL in your web browser.

## GitHub Team Collaboration Flow

### Set Up a GitHub Repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub. You can use the web interface to create a new repository with a README file.
    
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hngx-org/Titans-food-backend.git
 ```
    

### Step 8: Collaborate as a Team

1. **Branching Strategy**:
    
    - Create a new branch for each feature, bug fix, or task using.
```bash
    git checkout -b branch-name
 ```
2. **Development Workflow**:
    
- Write your code, make changes, and test locally.
        
- Commit your changes using.

```bash
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
```

- Push your new/first changes to the remote repository and set up an upstream(remote) branch at the same time.
```bash
git push -u origin branch-name.
```
- Subsequently, push to the remote repo using

```bash
git push origin branch-name.
or git push
```



3. **Pull Requests**:
    
    - Create a pull request on GitHub when you are ready to merge your changes into the main branch.
        
    - Request reviews from team members to ensure code quality.
        
    - Resolve any conflicts and make necessary changes based on feedback.
        
    - Merge the pull request when it's approved.
        
4. **Pulling Updates**:
- Pull from the default(parent) branch
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```
- Pull from your upstream branch.

```bash
git pull origin branch-name or git pull
```
### Collaboration Best Practices

- Communicate with your team using project management tools, chat platforms, or meetings.
    
- Use meaningful commit messages and follow a consistent code style to enhance code readability.
    
- Document your code and the project's architecture for better team understanding.
    
- Keep sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys) secure and out of version control.
    
- Regularly back up your code and database.
    

With this guide, you've successfully installed Laravel, initialized your project, and set up a GitHub team collaboration flow. Following best practices and effective collaboration will contribute to the success of your Laravel project.
